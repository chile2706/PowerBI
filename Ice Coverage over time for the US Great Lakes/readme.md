* This dashboard was based on [Power Bi 2021 Week 7 Challenge by Workout Wednesday](https://workout-wednesday.com/pbi-2021-w07/)
#### Data set:
* `maximum ice coverage` data from NOAAâ€™s Great Lakes Environmental Research Laboratory. A lake can have ice coverage ranging from 0 (no ice) to 100 (frozen over). [Link](https://data.world/dataveld/wow2021week07)

## Skills Overview
* `Button`
* `Matrix conditional formatting`: display different ranges of Maximum Ice coverage over time for the US Great Lakes.
* `Forcasting`: forcast the Average Ice coverage out to 2030
* `Anomaly Detection`: determine the anomalies in Average Ice coverage by Year

---
## Data Transformation
* `Unpivot`: change the individual lake columns into rows
* `Year Format to use Forcasting`

#### [Slicer] Year Range
(snapshot)

#### [Line chart] Average Coverage by Year
- add Line chart element, add Year field to x-axis, add Max coverage to y-axis, set coverage to avg
- fit trend line
(snapshot)

#### [Bar chart] Maximum Historical Coverage
- choose Max
- add label inside bars

#### [Matrix] Maximum Coverage by Lake
- Add:
- Exclude `All lakes`
- Removing row total and column total
- exclude `All lakes` for every visuals on the page
- conditional formating:
    * Background color: Build a set of conditional formatting Rules to Use five different colors for ice coverage (<25, <50, <75, <100, 100)
    * Build and apply Rules so that the contrast between your background colors and white or black font color passes the accessibility test for WCAG AA at https://contrastchecker.com
    * Add a star next to any value where the maximum ice coverage is 100%
